In this subproject the idea is to count (or better, estimate) also the number 
of authors and documents in which reactions and substances are published.

There are two dirs (everything is reported with yearly resolution):

	- rxns: Everything related to reactions
		{
		new_rxns_docs_auth.awk is a data collector from XML files, 
		runProc.sh calls it ^ over many processors, and consolidates results into rxns_data.txt
		count[Authors,Docs].awk processes output ^ and dumps into count[Authors,Docs].txt
		}
		- Number of authors involved in publishing new rxns 
		- Mean and median number of new rxns associated with each author, per year
		- Number of docs in which new rxns were published
		- Mean and median num of new rxns per document
		- Mean and median num of authors per document

	- subs: Everything related to substances (that are reported in reactions)
		
		{
		new_subs_docs_auth.awk is a data collector from XML files, 
		runProc.sh calls it ^ over many processors, and consolidates results into subs_yr_cnr_auth.txt
		count[Authors,Docs].awk processes output ^ and dumps into count[Authors,Docs].txt
		}

		- Number of authors involved in publishing new substs 
		- Mean and median number of new substances associated with each author, per year
		- Number of docs in which new substs were published
		- Mean and median num of new substs per document
		- Mean and median num of authors per document

		TODO: Something went wrong with author lists

	- use_subs: Yearly use of some particular substances, in reactions.
		- Acetic anhydride
