abstract  ="In recent years{,} convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in image recognition and shown powerful feature extraction ability. Here we show that CNNs can learn the inner structure and chemical information in the periodic table. Using the periodic table as representation{,} and full-Heusler compounds in the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) as training and test samples{,} a multi-task CNN was trained to output the lattice parameter and enthalpy of formation simultaneously. The mean prediction errors were within DFT precision{,} and the results were much better than those obtained using only Mendeleev numbers or a random-element-positioning table{,} indicating that the two-dimensional inner structure of the periodic table was learned by the CNN as useful chemical information. Transfer learning was then utilized by fine-tuning the weights previously initialized on the OQMD training set. Using compounds with formula X2YZ in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) as a second training set{,} the stability of full-Heusler compounds was predicted by using the fine-tuned CNN{,} and tungsten containing compounds were identified as rarely reported but potentially stable compounds."}

	abstract = {Starting from the experimental data contained in the inorganic crystal structure database, we use a statistical analysis to determine the likelihood that a chemical element A can be replaced by another B in a given structure. This information can be used to construct a matrix where each entry is a measure of this likelihood. By ordering the rows and columns of this matrix in order to reduce its bandwidth, we construct a one-dimension ordering of the chemical elements, analogous to the famous Pettifor scale. The new scale shows large similarities with the one of Pettifor, but also striking differences, especially in what comes to the ordering of the non-metals.}

    abstract = { For more than 150 years, the structure of the periodic system of the chemical elements has intensively motivated research in different areas of chemistry and physics. However, there is still no unified picture of what a periodic system is. Herein, based on the relations of order and similarity, we report a formal mathematical structure for the periodic system, which corresponds to an ordered hypergraph. It is shown that the current periodic system of chemical elements is an instance of the general structure. The definition is used to devise a tailored periodic system of polarizability of single covalent bonds, where order relationships are quantified within subsets of similar bonds and among these classes. The generalized periodic system allows envisioning periodic systems in other disciplines of science and humanities. }

These similarities are described. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the electronic and the compound approach to the system are discussed.&amp;nbsp; It is concluded that the current data availability and computational facilities make possible to think of a periodic system closer to the chemical milieu of compounds, bringing chemistry back to the system.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={2}, journal={Substantia}, author={Restrepo, Guillermo}, year={2019}, month={Dec.}, pages={115 - 124} }

abstract = {It has been claimed that relational properties among chemical substances are at the core of chemistry. Here we show that chemical elements and a wealth of their trends can be found by the study of a relational property: the formation of binary compounds. We say that two chemical elements A and B are similar if they form binary compounds AC and BC, C being another chemical element. To allow the richness of chemical combinations, we also included the different stoichiometrical ratios for binary compounds. Hence, the more combinations with different chemical elements, and with similar stoichiometry, the more similar two chemical elements are. We studied 4,700 binary compounds by using network theory and point set topology, we obtained well-known chemical families of elements, such as: alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, halogens, lanthanides, actinides, some transition metal groups and chemical patterns like: singularity principle, knight's move, and secondary periodicity. The methodology applied here can be extended to the study of ternary, quaternary and other compounds, as well as other chemical sets where a relational property can be defined.},
