This file is intended to be an instruction manual for this package.

Before anything, make sure the machine has the packages with which this package runs. These are listed on the requirements.txt file.
Just to be sure, simply run 

            pip install -r requirements.txt

and (if everything goes ok) everything should be ready for the next step.


On a high level, you only need to run the file "runTests.sh", which takes as arguments a data file and the number of cores to be used for the calculations. The execution of this code produces two kinds of files:
    1. The actual calculation results, that is, the PS representations that will be analyzed later. All of this is stored under the Data/ directory
    2. The output of each single execution of the program, which gives information such as substances that weren't analized, and the timings of operations.

This script runs the MPIgetTabs_v2.py code 5 times with increasing data sizes (from 50.000 to 1'000.000 compounds).

Run as: 

            ./runTests.sh {/path/to/datafile}.csv {Number of cores}
